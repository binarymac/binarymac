                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>
                I &hearts; Python. It is my perfered language for all my projects.
                Beautiful code, great documentation, awesome community, what's not 
                to love? I also enjoy using Django to help build at my webapps.

                <h3>Html & Css</h3>
                <p>I started HTML and CSS in 2010 by messing around with a couple
                webpages, and I've been hooked since. As annoying and inconsistant 
                as it can be, HTML is evolving faster than anything out there right now.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="skill_list_item ">
                <h3>Javascript & Jquery</h3>
                <p>
                Not my prefered language, but it works fine. Plus it's the only
                option to program on the client side (for now). 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="skill_list_item ">
                <h3>Linux & Open Source</h3>
                <p>
                I use and benefit from opensource on a daily basis, from Linux to Firefox.
                Nothing makes me happier than to work on open source projects, allowing
                me to give back something in return.
