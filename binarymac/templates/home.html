        Hey, I'm Mac,
        and I'm a Creator.
    </h1>

<div class="block">
    <h1>My creations are usually digital, such as apps, websites, and programs.</h1>

    <h1>These are some of things in my toolset</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>
            I &hearts; Python. It is my perfered language for all my projects.
            Beautiful code, great documentation, awesome community, what's not 
            to love? I also enjoy using Django to help build at my webapps. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Html & Css</h3>
            <p>I started HTML and CSS in 2010 by messing around with a couple
            webpages, and I've been hooked since. As annoying and inconsistant 
            as it can be, HTML is evolving faster than anything out there right now.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Javascript & Jquery</h3>
            <p>
            Not my prefered language, but it works fine. Plus it's the only
            option to program on the client side (for now). 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Linux & Open Source</h3>
            <p>
            I use and benefit from opensource on a daily basis, from Linux to Firefox.
            Nothing makes me happier than to work on open source projects, allowing
            me to give back something in return.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="block">
    <h2>I also developed and use The Creative Method on a daily basis</h2>
    <p>It's loosely based on the Scientific Method, and almost everything I do,
    including my workflow, revolves around it.</p>
    <p>You should check it out. </p>
